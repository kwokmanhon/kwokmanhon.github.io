        <h2 class="content-description"><div class="title">About me</div>I am from Hong Kong and studied in the United Kingdom for over 8 years and recently studied in UX Design in the Netherlands.<br><br>
            Studing UX gave me a lot of experience in creating real products, understanding the psychology behind UX Patterns. I learnt and understood the research process, creative process, business aspects, wireframing and also prototyping.<br><br>
            Overall, I was exposed to a very international environment since young where I studied in an International School, then in a Scottish Private Boarding school, proceeded to study in UK Universities and Netherlands. I have also worked with many people of all kinds of backgrounds and skills.<br><br>
            I am willing to learn, enthusiastic in design, and striving to be even better than ever and it would be great to meet you, work with you, or just have a chat!
